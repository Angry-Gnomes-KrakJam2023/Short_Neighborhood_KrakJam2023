# Short Neighborhood

`Short Neighborhood` is a small but solid project created in 48 hours for [KrakJam 2023](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/). It was nominated among 16 other  games for the top 10, but despite our best efforts didn't make it.

**`Short Neighborhood` ranked between 16th and 11th place out of 54 projects!**

## Short Description

You've got the most beautiful tree in the neighborhood. It causes immense jealousy among your neighbours who try to get rid of it under cover of the night. You goal is to protect its roots from being chopped of by gnomes.

## Lore

It was dark, peaceful night but one thing. Since you moved to the neighborhood you've been in ongoing war with GNOMES. This jealous creatures took liking to destroing everything you treasure.  
But...

They apparently took to game development and haven't left their tiny, dark houses in months. Until tonight!  
THEY MUST HAVE HEARD ABOUT YOUR MAGNIFICENT TREE!  
You left your house armed with flashlight. IT MUST scare them as they haven't seen sunlight in so long!

## How to play

- Top left side of the screen you can see tree's health, every time it loses one root, it also loses one heart
- Use your `arrow keys` or `A`, `D` to move your camera from left to right
- Use your `left mouse button` to change your flashlights
- Use your `right mouse button` to focus your light on enemies and PROTECT the tree
